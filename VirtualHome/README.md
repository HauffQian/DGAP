### Execution
Run the program by executing `sh scripts/inference.sh` in the behavior_cloning directory.

Control Flags:
```python
if_gpt = True   # Whether to use the GPT interactive interface for task planning
if_exe_all_action = True  # Whether to execute the complete plan after generation, as opposed to generating and executing step-by-step
```



Before execution, add your API key to gpt_policy.py:
```
api_key = [api-key1, api-key2]
api_key_num = 2
```
